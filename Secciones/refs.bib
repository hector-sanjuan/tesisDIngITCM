  abstract  = {An essential objective for many photovoltaic (PV) applications is represented by the so‐called maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Under uniform irradiance and ambient temperature conditions, the power versus voltage characteristic of a PV array is characterized by the presence of a unique point, termed maximum power point (MPP), where the power provided by the array itself attains its maximum value. Any other operating point leads to the extraction of a smaller PV energy. Therefore, in order to avoid the waste of PV energy, the working of the array in its MPP is mandatory. Since the position of the MPP continuously changes in time as a function of irradiance and temperature, it is necessary to continuously track it. Such an objective can be obtained by using proper MPPT control techniques. A large number of papers have appeared in the scientific literature during the last 15 years on the issue of MPPT, and as a result it may be difficult to decide the best technique for a given application. Therefore, this survey may hopefully be beneficial to students, researchers, and practitioners in PV systems. The article overviews the representative PV MPPT algorithms, organized into four main groups. The first group contains the so‐called “hill climbing” techniques, the second group contains the “curve fitting” techniques, the third group contains the “dynamical” techniques, and the fourth group includes all the techniques that do not belong to the first three groups.},

  abstract = {This work focuses on the development of a fast PEMFC impedance model, built starting from both physical and geometrical variables. Buckingham's $pi$ theorem is proposed to define non-dimensional parameters that allow suitably describing the relationships linking the physical variables involved in the process under-study to the fundamental dimensions. This approach is a useful solution for those problems, whose first principles-based models are not known, difficult to build or computationally unfeasible. The key contributions of the proposed similarity theory-based modelling approach are presented and discussed. The major advantage resides in its straightforward online applicability, thanks to very low computational burden, while preserving good level of accuracy. This makes the model suitable for several purposes, such as design, control, diagnostics, state of health monitoring and prognostics. Experimental data, collected in different operating conditions, have been analysed to demonstrate the capability of the model to reproduce PEMFC impedance at different loads and temperatures. This results in a reduction of the experimental effort for the FCS lab characterization. Moreover, it is highlighted the possibility to use the model with scaling-up purposes to reproduce the full stack impedance from single-cell one, thus supporting FC design and development from lab-to commercial system-scale.},

abstract = {Multi-objective optimization (MOO) has emerged as the preferable approach to tackle sustainability problems. The solution of MOO models is generally expressed as a set of Pareto optima, representing optimal trade-offs between given criteria. Identifying the final Pareto solution from this set for practical implementation is a challenging task, particularly when several criteria and decision-makers are involved in the analysis. In this work, we propose the rigorous method based on bilevel optimization and MOO to support decision-making in the post-optimal analysis of Pareto fronts. Our approach is capable of selecting non-dominated solutions which are particularly appealing for decision-makers, quantifying the distance between any suboptimal point of a MOO model and its Pareto front, and establishing improvement targets for suboptimal solutions that if attained would make them optimal. Overall, our method allows analyzing Pareto fronts and identifying a final Pareto point to be implemented in practice without the need to define explicit weights. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach through its application to the optimization of the UK electricity mix according to several sustainability indicators.}

Multiobjective optimization has been applied to many fields of science, including engineering, where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of trade-offs between two or more objectives that may be in conflict. Indeed, in many practical engineering applications, designers are making decisions between conflict objectives—for example, maximizing performance while minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle. In these cases, a multiobjective optimization study should be performed, which provides multiple solutions representing the trade-offs among the objective functions.}

abstract = {The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere is provoking an environmental crisis, as CO2 is considered the main responsible for the greenhouse effect and, consequently, global warming. The constant search for effective systems to capture CO2 has revealed the potential of microalgal cultures to perform this task. Microalgae are photosynthetic microrganisms able to uptake CO2 from both the atmosphere and flue gas emissions, converting it into biomass or other organic compounds. One important advantage of microalgae is that they present higher specific growth rates and biomass productivities than other photosynthetic organisms, such as terrestrial plants. This chapter presents an overview of the main studies aiming to evaluate the performance of microalgae for CO2 capture from the atmosphere or flue gas emissions. Also, the main limitations of using these microrganisms are described, highlighting the main research needs.}

Compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic models constructed from genome sequences enable quantitative insight into the transport and metabolism of compounds within a target organism. These metabolic models have long been utilized to generate optimized design strategies for an improved production process. Here, we describe the reconstruction, validation, and application of a genome-scale metabolic model for C. vulgaris UTEX 395, iCZ843. The reconstruction represents the most comprehensive model for any eukaryotic photosynthetic organism to date, based on the genome size and number of genes in the reconstruction. The highly curated model accurately predicts phenotypes under photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic conditions. The model was validated against experimental data and lays the foundation for model-driven strain design and medium alteration to improve yield. Calculated flux distributions under different trophic conditions show that a number of key pathways are affected by nitrogen starvation conditions, including central carbon metabolism and amino acid, nucleotide, and pigment biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, model prediction of growth rates under various medium compositions and subsequent experimental validation showed an increased growth rate with the addition of tryptophan and methionine.}",

    abstract = "{Motivation: Computational modeling in metabolic engineering involves the prediction of genetic manipulations that would lead to optimized microbial strains, maximizing the production rate of chemicals of interest. Various computational methods are based on constraint-based modeling, which enables to anticipate the effect of genetic manipulations on cellular metabolism considering a genome-scale metabolic network. However, current methods do not account for the presence of competing pathways in a metabolic network that may diverge metabolic flux away from producing a required chemical, resulting in lower (or even zero) chemical production rates in reality—making these methods somewhat over optimistic.Results: In this article, we describe a novel constraint-based method called RobustKnock that predicts gene deletion strategies that lead to the over-production of chemicals of interest, by accounting for the presence of competing pathways in the network. We describe results of applying RobustKnock to Escherichia coli's metabolic network towards the production of various chemicals, demonstrating its ability to provide more robust predictions than those obtained via current state-of-the-art methods.Availability: An implementation of RobustKnock is available via http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/∼tomersh/tools/Contact:naamat@cs.technion.ac.il; tomersh@cs.technion.ac.il}",

abstract = {Multi-objective optimization (MOO) has emerged as the preferable approach to tackle sustainability problems. The solution of MOO models is generally expressed as a set of Pareto optima, representing optimal trade-offs between given criteria. Identifying the final Pareto solution from this set for practical implementation is a challenging task, particularly when several criteria and decision-makers are involved in the analysis. In this work, we propose the rigorous method based on bilevel optimization and MOO to support decision-making in the post-optimal analysis of Pareto fronts. Our approach is capable of selecting non-dominated solutions which are particularly appealing for decision-makers, quantifying the distance between any suboptimal point of a MOO model and its Pareto front, and establishing improvement targets for suboptimal solutions that if attained would make them optimal. Overall, our method allows analyzing Pareto fronts and identifying a final Pareto point to be implemented in practice without the need to define explicit weights. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach through its application to the optimization of the UK electricity mix according to several sustainability indicators.}

Multiobjective optimization has been applied to many fields of science, including engineering, where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of trade-offs between two or more objectives that may be in conflict. Indeed, in many practical engineering applications, designers are making decisions between conflict objectives—for example, maximizing performance while minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle. In these cases, a multiobjective optimization study should be performed, which provides multiple solutions representing the trade-offs among the objective functions.}

abstract = {The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere is provoking an environmental crisis, as CO2 is considered the main responsible for the greenhouse effect and, consequently, global warming. The constant search for effective systems to capture CO2 has revealed the potential of microalgal cultures to perform this task. Microalgae are photosynthetic microrganisms able to uptake CO2 from both the atmosphere and flue gas emissions, converting it into biomass or other organic compounds. One important advantage of microalgae is that they present higher specific growth rates and biomass productivities than other photosynthetic organisms, such as terrestrial plants. This chapter presents an overview of the main studies aiming to evaluate the performance of microalgae for CO2 capture from the atmosphere or flue gas emissions. Also, the main limitations of using these microrganisms are described, highlighting the main research needs.}

Compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic models constructed from genome sequences enable quantitative insight into the transport and metabolism of compounds within a target organism. These metabolic models have long been utilized to generate optimized design strategies for an improved production process. Here, we describe the reconstruction, validation, and application of a genome-scale metabolic model for C. vulgaris UTEX 395, iCZ843. The reconstruction represents the most comprehensive model for any eukaryotic photosynthetic organism to date, based on the genome size and number of genes in the reconstruction. The highly curated model accurately predicts phenotypes under photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic conditions. The model was validated against experimental data and lays the foundation for model-driven strain design and medium alteration to improve yield. Calculated flux distributions under different trophic conditions show that a number of key pathways are affected by nitrogen starvation conditions, including central carbon metabolism and amino acid, nucleotide, and pigment biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, model prediction of growth rates under various medium compositions and subsequent experimental validation showed an increased growth rate with the addition of tryptophan and methionine.}",

Various computational methods are based on constraint-based modeling, which enables to anticipate the effect of genetic manipulations on cellular metabolism considering a genome-scale metabolic network. However, current methods do not account for the presence of competing pathways in a metabolic network that may diverge metabolic flux away from producing a required chemical, resulting in lower (or even zero) chemical production rates in reality—making these methods somewhat over optimistic.Results: In this article, we describe a novel constraint-based method called RobustKnock that predicts gene deletion strategies that lead to the over-production of chemicals of interest, by accounting for the presence of competing pathways in the network. We describe results of applying RobustKnock to Escherichia coli's metabolic network towards the production of various chemicals, demonstrating its ability to provide more robust predictions than those obtained via current state-of-the-art methods.Availability: An implementation of RobustKnock is available via http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/∼tomersh/tools/Contact:naamat@cs.technion.ac.il; tomersh@cs.technion.ac.il}",
